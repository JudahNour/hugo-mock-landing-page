# User Stories for SpeedrunSplits

This is a backlog of user stories for SpeedrunSplits, a fictitious tool to help people who enjoy emulating video games to keep track of the timing of their runs in order to practice and improve at speedrunning video games.

## Current Features

These are features that are currently "implemented" in SpeedrunSplits, and which feature on the landing page. These features do not actually exist (as the tool does not exist), but by this I mean that the landing page features these features.

### Illustrated Features

1. As a competitive speedrunner, I want to access leaderboards and compare my times against the global best, so that I can see where I stand among other players.
2. As a speedrunner, I want to easily start and stop a timer for each segment of my run, so that I can track how long each part of my speedrun takes.
3. As a speedrunner, I want to view detailed statistics on my splits (average times, best times, variance), so that I can analyze my performance trends.

### Other Features

1. As a speedrunner, I want to be alerted if I am significantly behind or ahead of my pace, so that I can adjust my strategy during the run to try and get a new best time.
2. As a speedrunner of multiple games, I want to have multiple profiles or save states for different games and categories, so that I can switch between speedruns easily.
3. As a content creator, I want to export/share my splits in a universal format, so that I can share them with my audience who is watching my speedruns so that they are able to follow.

## Potential Features Expansion

1. As a gaming coach, I want the ability to review my student’s split times and progress, so that I can provide targeted advice and training plans.

3. As a game historian, I want to archive and access historical speedrun data, so that I can document the evolution of speedrunning for different games.
